# Javascript Cheat Sheet

## Variable To Boolean

Turning a variable to a boolean expression can easily be done by using the shorthand (`!!`) syntax. This allows variables to be turned into boolean expressions.

**Example:**

`(!!variable) ? doSomething() : doSomethingElse()`

The expression above, tests if the variable `variable` is undefined or not by turning returning true if populated and false if undefined or false;

## Clang Formatter

Clang-Formatter is a coding fomatter for C# and is used to format and orangise code automatically. Using Clang-Formate for Javascript is considered good pratice for organising code and prevents version/source control overriding commits due to changes in code styles and indentations. Clang-Format can be added to many code editors and has many save options. For good pratice, format on save helps format regularly.
